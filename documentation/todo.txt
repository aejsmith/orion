TODO list
=========

- Investigate depth pre-pass. It's not always a win, depends on scene content.
  Sorting the render list in front to back order is possibly enough.
- Reload assets when changed (e.g. for shaders).
- Object system: serialization, properties, functions, type information.
  Something like Qt's object system, for example. Once this is implemented, we
  can replace things like manual asset type strings and component type IDs.
