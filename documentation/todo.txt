TODO list
=========

- Investigate depth pre-pass. It's not always a win, depends on scene content.
  Sorting the render list in front to back order is possibly enough.
- Reload assets when changed (e.g. for shaders).
- Asset loading error handling. Need some asset type specific error fallback.
  Also, for materials, need to be more resilient to problems. For example, if
  we have to fall back on an error shader, parameter setting will assert atm.
  Maybe don't have a fallback for shader, and have a fallback material instead.
- Object system: serialization, properties, functions, type information.
  Something like Qt's object system, for example. Once this is implemented, we
  can replace things like manual asset type strings and component type IDs.
